# About
QR Code Generator (QRCG) is a versatile and user-friendly tool for creating and saving custom QR codes. Designed with simplicity and functionality in mind, QRCG allows users to quickly generate QR codes for a wide rane of applications from sharing URLs and contact information to embedding custom data.

QRCG stores all generated QR codes as a temporary file. This allows you to test and play without cluttering up your computer. When you are ready, click save!

This tool is ideal for business cards, stickers, marketing materials, event management or even home use. My personal favorite thing to do is embed a QR code with my home network details that way when friends come over they can scan and connect easily and quickly.

### Key Features

- Input any data.
- Multiple error correction levels
- Instant preview.

## Installation

QRCG is available through the SimpleToolSuite plugin manager and does not have to be downloaded seperatly. If for some reason it is not available through the built in Plugin Manager, follow these steps

1. Download QRCG
2. Open SimpleToolSuite and navigate to the settings tab.
3. Under Plugin Location, select the "Open" button.
4. Drag and drop your STS-PLUGIN-QRCG folder into your plugin folder.
5. Navigate back to the plugins tab and click "Load Plugin"
6. Select QRCG and click launch.

If QRCG does not show in your plugins list after you click Load Plugins, verify that your plugin folder structure is correct. Your folder structure should be: `SimpleToolSuite/Plugins/STS-PLUGIN-QRCG/`

If you run into any problems throughout the process feel free to scroll back up to the top, and either join our discord to ask questions, or report a bug!
